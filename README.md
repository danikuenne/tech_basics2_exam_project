This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code. I have built a MVP for a platform that helps people find new friend groups.

# What is New Meet?
New Meet is a platform for connecting and meeting new people in a comfortable, group-oriented setting,
changing it from the usual and serious one-on-one interactions. As people are on the constant move all over the world,
finding like minded people can be very difficult.
With New Meet, you can effortlessly discover and join groups that align with your hobbies,
culture, and language preferences, creating opportunities to connect and get to know each other. Whether you're moving to
a new city or even a new country, I hope New Meet can help you feel more at ease and confident in finding new and amazing connections.

# How does it work?
- When the user runs the `app.py` they are greeted with the welcome page.
    The welcome page contains the start button, which is then used by the user to start the process of finding possible friend groups.

- Once clicked, the user is able to choose filters in order to find the right groups.
Those include firstly a city selection page, then gender selection page and lastly a page to choose their age group from.

- As soon as all filters are chosen, the platform will show you possible groups that fit those criteria.
- The user is then able to click on the idividual groups and get a more detailed information about them. Aditionally the user is able to send them a message.

- If no possible groups are found, the user will be greeted by a chatbot and is able to ask any other questions they might have.

# Instructions to run gui
1. For this platform to work, the files `app.py`, `helpers.py` as well as all `images` (the whole repository) need to be downloaded or cloned into the location of your choice.

2. Following that, open the repository in your directory using:
```
cd tech_basics2_exam_project
```
3. This project works with the libraries Tkinter and Pillow, so make sure to have access to both. If Pillow is not yet installed on your device please use:
```
 pip3 install pillow (for mac)
```
```
pip install pillow (for windows)
```
4. Lastly, please run the code using:
```
python3 app.py (for mac)
```
```
python app.py (for windows)
```
***I wish you the best of luck and much fun finding new friends!!***
